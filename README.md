# OS Tutorial
Welcome! This is a self-learning tutorial in which we will be creating on operative system **from scratch**!

### But what will we cover?
**Everything**. We will start with our bootloader, and then jump into the kernel code.

### Is this tutorial a platform-dependent one?
Absolutely **no**! You can follow it in any OS you like to! Although, I will be using Arch Linux.

### What previous acknowledgments do I need?
Almost **nothing**! You only need to know how to write simple code. I will guide you through all the learning steps.

## How to use this tutorial?
The tutorial is structured in a chapter-like way. Every chapter is self-contained in its own directory.

The chapters' directories are named in a logical way (e.g. `001-getting-ready`).

Every chapter contains a `README.md` file. Start reading from there!

## Feeling ready?
You can already jump to `001-getting-ready` and start developing your OS
